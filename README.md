# Donate API

Central API for a larger **Donate** project aimed at allowing people to donae compute time from their home computers or laptops to a chosen computational task. These 'jobs' will be specified by researchers and will allow them to perform high quality computation on a budget.

Works on a distributed system built around transferring docker images.
